# 🌍**ECOAIR IMPACT MONITOR: MULTI-DOMAIN AI AUDITOR**:

### **🔗 [View Live App Here](https://ecoairimpactmonitor-ucwa28rar35wmelkhxl28j.streamlit.app/)**

Transforming raw environmental data into Biological, Ecological, and Fiscal Intelligence for a sustainable future.

--**OVERVIEW**:

EcoAir Impact Monitor is an end-to-end analytical tool designed for the Hack for Earth challenge. While standard trackers only provide raw AQI figures, our "AI Auditor" interprets these numbers to predict their real-world consequences on human health, local ecosystems, and urban economies.

--**The Triple-Audit Framework**:

Our platform utilizes a multi-page architecture to provide specialized insights:
Biological & Respiratory Audit: Analyzes PM_{2.5}, PM_{10}, and O_3 concentrations to calculate real-time respiratory risk percentages for vulnerable populations.
Environmental Impact Audit: Estimates Carbon Sequestration Loss, showing how pollution inhibits the city's natural ability to offset CO_2.
Fiscal Auditor: Predicts the economic burden on healthcare systems and the productivity loss (GDP impact) caused by air-related illnesses.

-- **UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**:

This project is built to support the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development:
SDG 3 (Good Health): By providing early warning for respiratory distress.
SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities): By giving city planners a data-driven tool for environmental monitoring.
SDG 13 (Climate Action): By highlighting the degradation of natural carbon sinks.
